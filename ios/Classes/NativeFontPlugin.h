/**
 * Common weight values roughly correspond to weight description words:
 *
 * 100 - Thin
 * 200 - Extra Light (Ultra Light)
 * 300 - Light
 * 400 - Regular (Normal„ÄÅPlain)
 * 500 - Medium
 * 600 - Semi Bold (Demi Bold)
 * 700 - Bold
 * 800 - Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)
 * 900 - Black (Heavy)
 *
 * @discussion Why is it roughly corresponding? There are differences under some fonts. For example, in the division list of font weight description in Adobe Typekit fonts, it lists `Heavy` as 800 instead of 900. In addition, in the Photoshop and Sketch, `Ultra Light` is 100, and `Thin` is 200.
